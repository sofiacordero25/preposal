## what idea(s) do you have for your final project?

our idea for this project is to create a pokedex. the pokedex will contain a set number of pokemon characters. the user will enter a number from 1-50 and an image of a pokemon character, along with its name, hieight, weight, and other defining characteristics. the user will be able to pick this pokemon or will have the option to view others before selecting. each pokemon will be valued with a strength unbeknownst to the user that will be used to determine a winner in a battle against the computer, which chooses a character randomly to fight with. 



## if you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

my partners for this project will be matthew burhimer & nazli iclal karaman.



## do you have any questions of your own?

our only question is if this idea is substaintial enough to meet the expectations of the final project and if not, what elements could be added?
